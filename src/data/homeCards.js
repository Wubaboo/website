        Here's a collection of memory games that I made (excluding Sequences)
        with JavaScript and React. My motivation is that Alzheimer's runs in my
        family. This is my attempt at combatting it. I intend on releasing a
        mobile app soon!

        <b>ytSheetMusic</b> is a tool I made to extract sheet music from YouTube
        videos containing sheet music. It extracts the sheets music portions
        from the videos, and concatenates the results in a PDF file.

        It's made with Python, JavaScript, Flask, React, and AWS.
